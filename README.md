# djsCommandDeployer

A simple, easy to use module that houses a Discord Client class that has two additional functions that can create, update and delete global and guild specific commands for your Discord App.

## Installation

```bash
npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:The-LukeZ/djsCommandDeployer.git
npm install djs-command-deployer
```

## Usage

#### Folder structure

_The `src` folder it can be any folder. Just the `commands` folder should be a subfolder of the directory your `index.js` is located in._

```
üìÇsrc
 ‚î£ üìÑindex.js
 ‚îó üìÇcommands
   ‚îóüìÇutility
     ‚î£ üìÑping.js
     ‚îó üìÑyour-private-command.js
```

#### The command file

> **Note that for using this you need to install [discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/)!**

<summary>Fields in the command file (Click to expand)</summary>

| Key name | Description                                                                                               | Default |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| ignore   | If set to `true` then this command will be ignored upon refreshing                                        | `false` |
| guildIds | An Array of guild ids in which the command should be registered/updated ; command is global if not set    | []      |
| data     | The raw command data [Learn more about it here](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands) | `-`     |
| run      | The function to call (It's only important for your own logic - so name this whatever you want)            | `-`     |

`-` means that it doesn't have a default value

</details>

```js
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

module.exports = {
    ignore: true,
    guildIds: ["123456789", "987654321"], // Note: This wont automatically delete them from guilds!
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("ping")
        .setDescription("Replies with Pong!"),

    // The function to call whenever the command is executed (Doesnt matter when calling client.deployCommands())
    async run(interaction) {
        await interaction.reply("Pong!");
    },
};
```

### Deploy the commands

```js
const { Events, GatewayIntentBits } = require("discord.js");
// Name it whatever you want
const Client = require("djs-command-deployer");
const { join: pathJoin } = require("node:path");
require("dotenv").config();

// Set up your client ; use the guide for example (https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/main-file)

// Create a new client instance
let client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

// When the client is ready, run this code (only once).
client.once(Events.ClientReady, (readyClient) => {
    console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${readyClient.user.tag}`);

    // Call deployCommands to refresh your commands
    readyClient.deployCommands(
        pathJoin(__dirname, "commands", "utility")
        // Optional: logOptions object
    );
});

// Log in to Discord with your client's token
client.login(process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN);
```

### Delete a guild-command

There are two options to do this: Either with the command's ID or his name.

In this example we are building a manager-command that has StringOptions for the command and the guild id where one can paste in the ID or the name.\

````js
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

module.exports = {
    guildIds: ["the-id-of-my-private-guild"],
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("manage-commands")
        .setDescription("Replies with Pong!")
        .addStringOption((op) =>
            op
                .setName("command")
                .setDescription(
                    "The command's ID or name to be removed in the given server"
                )
        )
        .addStringOption((op) =>
            op
                .setName("server-id")
                .setDescription("The server's ID to remove the command from")
        ),

    // The function to call whenever the command is executed (Doesnt matter when calling client.deployCommands())
    async run(interaction) {
        const serverId = ctx.options.getString("server-id");
        const command = ctx.options.getString("command");
        await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true }); // Defer to remove the risk of not responding in time
        try {
            await interaction.client.deleteCommand(command, serverId);
        } catch (err) {
            console.error("Command not deleted due to", err);
            return await interaction.editReply({
                embeds: [
                    new EmbedBuilder()
                        .setTitle("‚ùå Command not deleted due to an error")
                        .setDescription("```" + err + "```")
                        .setColor(0xee0000),
                ],
            });
        }
        await interaction.editReply("‚úÖ Command deleted");
    },
};
````

#### `logOptions`

| Option name | Description / Example                            | Default |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `status`    | Logs like `Started refreshing X global commands` | `true`  |
| `ignored`   | Logs like `Command 'user' ignored`               | `true`  |
| `created`   | Logs like `Created 'user'`                       | `true`  |
| `updated`   | Logs like `Updated 'user'`                       | `true`  |
| `deleted`   | Logs like `Deleted 'user'`                       | `true`  |
| `noLogs`    | No logs at all (besides errors)                  | `false` |
